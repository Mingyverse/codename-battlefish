  description: "Rock Bass (Ambloplites rupestris) are a small game fish that got
    their name from their preferred habitat of lakes and streams with rocky bottoms.
    They are sometimes also called goggle-eye or red-eye because of their big, reddish
    eyes. This freshwater fish species is known for their aggressive nature, especially
    during spawning season when they become more territorial. They\u2019re carnivorous
    and eat pretty much anything smaller than them including insects, crustaceans,
    fish, and crayfish."
