  description: 'Salmon are remarkable fish known for their ability to thrive in both
    freshwater and saltwater environments. They are anadromous, meaning they are
    born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean to grow and mature, and return to freshwater
    rivers to spawn. There are several species of salmon, including the Atlantic
    salmon and Pacific species like Chinook, Sockeye, and Coho. '
