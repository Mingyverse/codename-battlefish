  description: The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), commonly known as the
    betta, is a freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia, namely Cambodia, Laos,
    Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Although aquarium specimens
    are widely known for their brilliant colours and large, flowing fins, the natural
    coloration of B. splendens is generally green, brown and grey, while the fins
    are short; wild fish exhibit strong colours only when agitated. Betta splendens
    are among the most popular aquarium fish in the world, due to their diverse and
    colorful morphology and relatively low maintenance.
